<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Nafisa Shaik, a passionate Computer Science student with a strong interest in software development, artificial intelligence, and problem-solving. I have a solid foundation in core computer science subjects such as Data Structures & Algorithms, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and Database Systems, and I consistently work on strengthening my logical and analytical thinking through competitive programming and LeetCode-style problems.</p>

<p>I have hands-on experience building end-to-end AI-powered and full-stack applications, including projects like AI Mock Interview platforms, personalized learning path engines, document intelligence systems, and machine learning-based tampering detection models. My work spans across React.js frontends, FastAPI/Flask and Node.js backends, MongoDB, SQL, and LLM integrations, with a strong focus on scalable design, clean architecture, and real-world usability. I have also participated in multiple national-level hackathons, gaining exposure to rapid prototyping, teamwork, and problem-driven innovation.</p>

<p>Beyond technical skills, I am recognized for my initiative, leadership, and continuous learning mindset. I was selected among the top 80 candidates out of 18,000+ applicants for LinkedIn CoachIn 2025, and I actively seek opportunities that challenge me to grow both technically and professionally. My long-term goal is to build impactful technology solutions and secure opportunities at top global tech companies, while continuously evolving as a high-quality software engineer.</p>
